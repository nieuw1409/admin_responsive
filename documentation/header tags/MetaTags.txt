This file explains the purpose of the various meta tags options
available with Header Tags SEO. These explanations may not be
complete. For more information, search them on the Internet. To alter
any of these that have various options, the includes/header_tags.php
file will need to be edited.

google: Controls how google searches your site. The default setting
        is All, which means that google will index all pages of your
        site as they are found and follow all links on those pages.
        This is the desired setting. But some sites may want to 
        alter these. 
language: Tells the search engines which language the site is intended for.

noodp: If your site is listed on DMoz, a major directory site, then they have
       created their own description of your site most likely. Sometimes, the
       description they use is not the best for your site. This options allows
       you to override that description so that your own is used. This tag
       works for all major search engines.       

noydir: Same as the above but only works for Yahoo.

revisit: Tells the search engines when they can revisit the site. Rarely used
         anymore due to how frequently the search engines visit. They may not
         pay attention to it. But if your bandwidth is limited, changing the
         setting for this may help.
         
robots: Same as the google meta tag above but applies to all search engines.
 
unspam: An attempt by unspam.com to prevent the search engines from harvesting 
        email addresses. May not be heeded by all search engines. 
        
replyto: Lists your email address. This is not recommended for most sites but
         is useful for some.
