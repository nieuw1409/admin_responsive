    will, hopefully, help make the installation easier.

		Header Tags SEO v3.0

Date: 04 April 2008

This is a complete replacement of Header Tags Controller V 2.6.4. Some
file names have been kept the same for ease of updating but, in most
cases, they are not compatible.

-> The code is 100% langage compliant.
-> Removed the english/header_tags.php file in favor of database entries.
-> Fixed a bug introduced in a previous version. A spelling mistake
   would make Page Control fail in some cases. I only mention this here because 
   it was a nasty little bug I could never locate. So anyone having that problem
   should consider upgrading.
-> Added control options to admin->Configuration.
-> Added additional meta tag options. It is doubtful these will be used that much
   but a number of requests were received for this option so it was added.
-> Added an option to view the title and meta tags on the actual web page from admin.
-> Added Social Bookmark code.
-> Added code to apply mouseover text to the sites logo - unique for each page.
-> Added code to have the breadcrumb use the header tags titles.
-> Added an exclude list in admin/includes/functions/header_tags.php that prevents
   header tags code from being added to certain files (like checkout pages). This is
   because those pages don't need tags and excluding them will simplify matters.
-> Added option to Page Control and Fill Tags so that the keywords can be dynamically generated from the
   pages on the site. Currently, the code only supports single keywords but I plan on
   changing that. There is an option in admin to only pick keywords that fall within the
   keyword density settings.
-> Added an automatic page add feature. You still have to edit the actual file in the 
   root but that's all.
-> Added easy install instruction for STS shops. There is just one change to make and the
   two contribution work together.
-> Added code to have the new features work with BTS based shops. There may be a few cases
   where an option doesn't work due to how BTS handles the files, but they should be
   minimal and not anything to cause a great stir.
-> Changed how title, description and keywords are built. This should provide more
   flexibility for those that want that option. Each item has a sort order and is displayed
   in the string of text based on that sort order. So, for example, the title of a page can
   contain some entered text, the default title and the category and manufacturers names (if applicable), in any
   order.
-> Added an Un-Install file to completely remove Header Tags from the database. This should
   make testing and troubleshooting easier.
-> Added code to use curl instead of standard php file calls. The code will try curl first
   and then switch to a file command if it is not present.
-> Tested in MS2, RC2, STS and BTS shops.
