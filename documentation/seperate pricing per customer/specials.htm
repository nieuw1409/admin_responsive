<p style="color:#ff0000;">Specials can be defined for each product
in your catalog. You can also define specials for each customer group. In this
example A Bug's Life is on sale for each of my 3 defined customer groups
(Retail, Wholesale and Volume Purchase Agreement). This is useful if you have
some old stock that you want to blow out :-)</p>
