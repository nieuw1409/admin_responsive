<p style="color:#ff0000;">In this screen you can see the Customers
list. The list can be sorted by any of the fields. If Marvin Miller was a new
account that had entered a tax number you would see a red light under the RA
field. RA is an acronym for 'Requires Approval'. If you get a <i>lot</i> of new
account requests that use tax numbers (wholesale accounts) then it will be
easier to sort this screen by the RA field so that you can more easily perform
approvals.</p>
<p style="color:#ff0000;">At the bottom of the list is a box that
shows how many of your customers belong to each group.</p>
