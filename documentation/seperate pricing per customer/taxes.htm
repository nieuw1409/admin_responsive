<p style="color:#ff0000;">This is the screen you see when you edit a
customer group. In the first box titled <i>Personal</i> you can choose whether
to show prices with tax included and also if you want to exempt a group from
being charged tax. Displaying prices with tax included is primarily used for
European sites where this is required by law. In the box titled <i>Exempt Group from Specific Tax Rates</i> you can tick specific taxes the group is exempt for. This has no effect if you made the group Tax Exempt.</p>
