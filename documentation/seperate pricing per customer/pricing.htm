<p style="color:#ff0000;">This picture shows an individual product
being edited in your site's catalog. For each customer group you create you will
get a new field to enter a price. As seen above the Retail price is 299.99 In
the empty boxes below you can enter the lower <i>Wholesale price</i> and below
that the much lower <i>Volume Purchase Agreement price</i>. When you create your
own groups their names will be listed here - Wholesale and Volume Purchase
Agreement are only examples. The prices defined here are the prices people will
see when logged in as members of their respective groups.</p>
