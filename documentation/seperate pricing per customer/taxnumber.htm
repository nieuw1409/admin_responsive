<p style="color:#ff0000;">&nbsp; When a new user registers on your
site they are provided with an updated form that now includes a Tax Number
field. If they enter any information in that box two things happen. One is that
an email is sent to the Site Administrator notifying him that an account needs
approval. This feature was implemented so that random visitors do not have
access to wholesale pricing unless they are approved (screened for legitimacy).
Until a user is approved by the Site Admin they will only see Retail pricing.</p>
<p style="color:#ff0000;">&nbsp; The second thing that happens upon
tax number entry is that a red light is set in the Customers section of the osC
Admin. This enables the Site Admin to readily see all the accounts that require
approval. The light can be turned off when the customer's profile is edited. If
your site gets <i>many</i> wholesale account requests per day then it's easiest
to sort the customer list by the RA field. RA is an acronym for Requires
Approval.</p>
<p style="color:#ff0000;">&nbsp; When the Site Administrator decides
that the user is legitimate he can then move them into any of the user groups he
has created. This is accomplished by editing the customer profile and setting
the group. At this point he can also turn off the red light. When the client
logs in the next time they will then see the pricing for the group they have
been assigned to. <i>It's important to note that the client must log-off and the
log back in to see the updated pricing. </i>This is also important to keep in
mind when testing.</font></p>
