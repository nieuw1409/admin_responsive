- What it Solves, What it Does &amp; How it Works</p>
<p align="left" style="color: #ff0000;">What it Solves</p>
<p>&nbsp; Separate Pricing was created to allow a website to
have different pricing for the same products for different users. This is
particularly useful for sites that need to <i>retail &amp; wholesale</i> the
same products or for sites that have customers that get different pricing
depending on their past volume of purchases.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Because the stock osCommerce release doesn't
support this scenario the site owner can only have <i>one pricing level</i> on
their entire site. This creates some problems for businesses that need to <i>both</i>
wholesale &amp; retail products because the site owner has to choose what
pricing to display. For instance;</p>
<ul>
  <li>If he chooses <i>wholesale</i> pricing then everyone
    on the Internet can see the discounted rate - and that's something that
    wholesale account purchasers <b><i>don't like</i></b>. If a business's
    wholesale customer knows that the whole world can see &amp; get <b><i>their</i>
    </b>pricing then they usually won't do business with you <i>ever.<br>
    </i><br>
    </li>
  <li>If the site owner chooses to display <i>retail</i>
    pricing then a different problem occurs. If <i>wholesale </i>customers
    come to your site then they will be put off by your 'high' prices.</li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Tahoma">&nbsp; </font><font face="Arial">As a real-world example, suppose you are selling
plumbing supplies. <img border="0" src="images/pwd0766s.jpg" width="99" height="102" align="right"></p>
<p>&nbsp; The general public should see the regular <i>retail</i>
rate and contractors that deal with you in volume should see a lower
<i>wholesale</i> price. This is what Separate Pricing was created to do - <i>display
different prices for different people</i>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: #ff0000;">What it Does</p>
<p>In addition, Separate Pricing allows you to do more then just show different pricing. Some of it's many features include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b><a href="pricing_groups.htm" target="_blank">Multiple
    Pricing Groups</a>.</b> You can create groups such as <i>Retail, Wholesale,
    Volume Purchase Agreement </i>or whatever you like. <i><b>Retail is required</b></i>&nbsp;
    and is installed by default, but you can create as many groups as you desire
    with names of your choosing. After groups are created you can then <a href="pricing.htm" target="_blank">specify
    pricing for existing or new products</a>. Additionally, you can <a href="attributes.htm" target="_blank">set group pricing for attributes</a> (plus hide them for one or more groups).<br>
    <br>
    </li>
  <li><b><a href="taxes.htm" target="_blank">Taxes on a Per
    Group Basis</a>.</b> You can edit a customer group and either enable or
    disable tax for that group. In addition, you can can choose whether or not
    to display the price with tax included - something that's useful for
    European stores where law requires displayed prices to include tax plus (new in version 4.2) you can be specific which tax a customer group is exempt for. This is needed for example in Canada or when a tax (like VAT) is different for retail versus a company (say 20% for retail and 10% for a company). Then you can add both taxes to the product and edit the settings to make each group exempt for one of those taxes.<br>
    <br>
    </li>
  <li><b><a href="specials.htm" target="_blank">Define Specials for different
    groups</a>.</b> This
    means you can have the same products on sale for different groups - with
    different prices as you see fit.<br>
    <br>
    </li>
  <li><b><a href="taxnumber.htm" target="_blank">Tax Number
    field</a>.</b> When a customer creates an
    account on your site they have the option of including a <i>tax number</i>.
    If they enter a tax number then an email is sent to the site's administrator
    letting him know that the account needs to be approved. Once the site admin
    actually <i>verifies</i> that the customer is legitimate he can then move
    the customer to whichever group the customer belongs in. The default for <i>all</i>
    accounts is <i>Retail</i> and customers will only be able to see <i>retail</i>
    pricing until they have been approved. In addition to the email, the
    Customers section of the osC admin will show a red light next to any
    accounts that need to be approved for a wholesale account.<br>
    <br>
    </li>
  <li><b><a href="paymentshipping.htm" target="_blank">Payment, Shipping &amp; Order Total
    Modules</a>.</b> <i>Existing</i>
    Payment, Shipping modules, &amp; Order Total modules can be enabled or disabled on a customer
    group basis or on an <a href="customerlevel.htm" target="_blank"> individual customer
    level</a>. This is a very powerful
    feature. Let's assume you have a customer that buys a lot of products from
    you. They may <i>require</i> credit terms and refuse any other courier then
    UPS. If that's the case then you can simply edit that particular customer
    and only show a payment option of <i>credit terms</i> and also <i>only</i>
    show a courier option of UPS - regardless of how many payment or shipping
    modules you have installed. It should be noted that this contribution <i>does
    not contain any payment or shipping modules</i> - this feature works with
    whatever modules <i>you</i> have installed or the pre-existing ones that are
    <i>enabled</i> in the stock osC release.<br>
    <br>
    </li>
  <li><b><a href="login.htm" target="_blank">Administrator
    Log-On</a>. </b>The site's administrator
    account has the ability to log-in as a member of <i>any</i> group. This
    saves you from having to create several accounts for testing the customer
    groups.<br>
    <br>
    </li>
  <li><b><a href="customers.htm" target="_blank">Cosmetic/Appearance
    Functions</a>.</b> In the osC Admin
    you can sort customers by any field such as company name, last name, first
    name, customer group etc. In addition, the Customers section will show how
    many clients you have and what groups they belong to.<br />
    In the orders page the customer group <a href="orders.htm" target="_blank">will be shown</a> (if you choose to add that to the page)</li>
    <li><b>Send <a href="newsletter.htm" target="_blank">Newsletters</a> or <a href="mail.htm"  target="_blank">E-mail</a> to certain Customer Groups only</b> (optional install.)
</ul>
<p style="color: #ff0000;">How It Works</p>
<p>&nbsp; The first thing you will want to do after
installation is to create customer groups. These groups are created by going
into your site's <i> osC Admin</i> and selecting the <i> Customers</i> link. After that you will
see a link called <i> Customers Groups</i>. Click on that and you will see the default
Retail Group. Select <i> Insert</i> to create a new group. At this point you can choose
the name, whether to display the price with tax included, whether the group
should be taxed and also define which Payment &amp; Shipping methods will apply
to that group. Create as many groups as are required for your business.</p>
<p>&nbsp; The next step will be to edit your existing
products and enter the new pricing for each product. You do this in the
conventional osC manner, by going into the<i> osC Admin</i> and clicking on <i> Catalog</i> and
editing each product. Once you edit a product you will see a field for each
customer group you created. Enter the discounted pricing you desire in each
field.</p>
<p>&nbsp; After that you may want to define specials. This is
done in the standard osC manner, by going into <i> osC Admin</i>, clicking on <i> Catalog</i>
and then <i>Specials</i>. At this point you can create new specials by choosing the
<i> New
Product</i> button and then selecting the product from the drop-down list. You then
define what group the special applies to, the price and also the date it should
be in affect (if desired). To make the same special for another group just
follow the same steps and choose a different group and price.</p>
<p>&nbsp; To test your newly entered prices just go to your
website and log in as the defined <i> Site Administrator</i>. The Site Administrator is
defined by entering their email address into the <span style="color: #0000FF;">catalog\includes\languages\english\login.php
</span> file. If you do a search of that file for the word <b>root</b>
you will find the specific area to enter the address. Once you go to log in you will be presented with a screen asking which group you want to log in under. From that point the site
behaves exactly as if you were a member of that group.</p>
<p>&nbsp; From an operational perspective you can just move
any of your existing customers into whatever groups you have defined. If a new
user registers with a tax number then the Site Administrator will receive an
email notifying them that the account needs to be approved. As well, a <a href="redlight.htm" target="_blank"> red light
will be set next to that customer</a> in the osC Admin's customer list. You then
enter the <i> osC Admin</i>, highlight the customer and then select <i>Edit</i>. You can then
assign which group the customer belongs in (whether or not they have been
approved for a wholesale account) and also turn off the red light notification
next to their name. From that point on, when that customer logs into your site
they will see the pricing for the group that you assigned them to (wholesale or
what have you).</p>
<p>&nbsp; <i>It should be noted that customers will not see
updated pricing unless they log off and log back in or if their session expires.</i></p>
<p style="color: #ff0000;">General Installation Information</p>
<p>The Separate Pricing 4.x contribution comes with extensive
documentation to make installation as easy as possible. It is a large
contribution so the easiest way to install it is on a new site with no
modifications. In that case you can simply upload the included files and run the
SQL install script.</p>
<p>If you have a heavily modified site then you will have to
perform a manual installation. The easiest way to do this is with a file <a href="http://www.compareandmerge.com/" target="_blank">compare
&amp; merge utility</a>. If you don't have one you can use the one referenced
here as they have a free trial that lasts for 50 files, which is enough to
accomplish the task.</p>
<p>If your interest is in doing a <i>truly</i> manual
installation with a Text Editor then<i> tested </i>file by file documentation is
included with the contribution.</p>
<p style="color: #ff0000;">Support</p>
<p>Support for this contribution can be found in the <a href="http://forums.oscommerce.com/index.php?showtopic=53436&amp;view=getlastpost" target="_blank">Separate
Price Contribution Support Thread</a> at the osCommerce website. Please note
that support for this contribution is provided on a <i>limited</i> basis. It's <i>not</i>
the author(s) responsibility to ensure the contribution works with other's that
are installed nor to trouble shoot installation issues. </p>
<p>A <i>great deal </i>of testing time has been spent on the
documentation to ensure that it is <i> accurate</i> and <i> reliable</i> so conflicts with other
contributions <i>should be</i> the only potential issue that may arise. In that
case, if courtesy support is not forthcoming, you might find it worthwhile to
consult a dedicated PHP programmer. </p>
<p><i>While every effort has been made to ensure this
contribution is as bug free as possible, as with all osCommerce contributions,
they are installed at your own risk. </i></p>
