<p style="color:#ff0000;">In this picture of the osC Admin you can
see three different Customer Groups. The first, Retail, is a default of the
Separate Price Contribution. The Wholesale &amp; Volume Purchase Agreement are
newly created. Normally the first thing a person will do is create groups
specific to their needs. After that you can define prices for your products by <a href="pricing.htm">editing
the existing products</a> or entering new ones into your osCommerce website.</p>
