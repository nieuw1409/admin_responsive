Some of these places are ripped directly from the pages of Jordan&#39;s books, made flesh with Legend&#39;s unparalleled pixel-pushing ways.

During your travels, you quickly discover that four locations are crucial to your success in the game. Not surprisingly, these locations are the homes of The Wheel of Time&#39;s main characters. Some of these places are ripped directly from the pages of Jordan&#39;s books, made flesh with Legend&#39;s unparalleled pixel-pushing ways.
