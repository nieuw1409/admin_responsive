     mainpage.php GERMAN by Matthijs - mattice@xs4all.nl
    
     This page will be shown on the first page of the catalog
     (default.php) instead of the standard message.

     You can write your php/html straight into this.
     This means you can drop in another table on the main
     page where you could create (manually) a featured product
     or just drop in some nice graphics. I've included a small sample
     below using existing box-code/stylesheets so you get the idea.   

     BE AWARE that changes (and possible errors/typo's) are
     directly used by the catalog. There is no preview option,
     changes are directly 'live'. So be carefull. 
     
     All changed and all fixes have been fixed for current snap shot...

This module demonstrates how easy it can be to adapt existing code in OSC.<br/> All I had to do was add one single line to define_languages.php (admin) to make sure it always looks for the mainpage.php file. Obviously I had to then implement it in the Admin &amp; Catalog side, but that's not a big deal as you've just found out.<p> You can edit the contents of this file from within the Admin ( -&gt; CATALOG -&gt; DEFINE MAINPAGE)<br/></p><p>If you can't open/edit the /[language]/mainpage.php file you should probably set the right permissions. You'll get a warning anyway. </p>
