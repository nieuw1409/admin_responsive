                      <h1>Preamble</h1>
                          <p>Easy Populate (EP) was designed to provide a vehicle for moving products from 
                            one shop to another or as a means to store product sets for developers. Please keep this in mind before complaining about how it works. <strong>:o)</strong><br>
                      </p>
                          <h2>What does EP do now?</h2>
                      <p>EP as progressed to a tool for exporting product details for easy editing
                            in text or with Excel. After, we can import the product detail back into
                      the osCommerce database with changes. </p>
                          <p>Easy Populate&nbsp; lets you quickly populate and update thousands of products
                            in many categories for an OSC store with data from an; Excel spreadsheet,
                            OpenOffice spreadsheet, Filemaker database, Access database. Any delimited
                      text file (you can now set a configuration var for the separator character). </p>
                          <p>Easy Populate can also export sets of products based on a category, manufacturer, or
                            the product's status (visible/not visible) for editing, moving to another
                      site or storing.</p>
                          <p>Easy Populate supports multiple categories, multiple languages, creates Categories
                            and Manufacturers on the fly, unlimited levels of categories/subcategories
                            are supported, products without pictures can be defaulted to a standard
                            "no picture available" image and file uploading via browser or grab a
                      file from the temp directory.</p>
                          <h2>What does EP *NOT* do well?</h2>
                          <p>So far, EP does not handle attributes well. When viewing product export, it
                            may be difficult to understand how it works. As such, I'do not recommend 
                      that anyone use EP for managing attributes. But is can be done if you are patient.</p>
                          <p>EP does not handle &quot;download&quot; attributes.</p>
                          <p>The default behavior of EP is to Add &amp; Update. If you download a product,
                            change its category, then upload, EP will add the product to the new category.
                            EP will not remove it from the previous category. EP does not move products from one category to another either.</p>
                          <p>The code is improved but still needs work. The code will read the entire
                            product database into server memory before producing the export. New features
                            improve the export file building to avoid loading the entire export file
                            in memory also.<br>
                      </p>
                          <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <ul style="color: #FF0000">

                                2.3.1</a>, is required, it will not work with previous versions of osCommerce
</font></li>
                              <li><font color="#000000">If you have made database changes to the products, products_description,
                                or other product or category related tables, you may have some
                          issues running the stock Easy Populate.</font></li>
                              <li><font color="#000000">Easy Populate uses the product_model field (model number) to identify the record
                                to update. It won't work without the model number.  Each row should have a
                          unique model number. i.e. you can't give all your products a product_model of "test".</font></li>
                              <li><font color="#000000">Easy Populate will import tab, comma, semi-colon, or any other
                                user-defined-separator delimited files.  The default separator for CSV files in the US is a comma. The default separator for your country may vary.
                                If you want to
                                change the separator, there is a variable in the configuration section
                  of easypopulate.php.  Whatever you change it to, test it!  Remember that&nbsp;
                                any of those separator characters anywhere in your data will cause
                          Easy Populate to think that's another column of data unless you use double quotes to enclose the data! (see next note)</font></li>
                              <li><font color="#000000">As of Version 2.76d, you may now enable the Excel safe output and input.
                                This will now safely export any data (English test only), edit in excel,
                                and re-import the data safely preserving tabs, commas, and carriage returns
                          in your product’s description.</font></li>
                              <li><font color="#000000">The first line of each Easy Populate
                                file must have be a header row.  If you upload a file without the headers,
                          Easy Populate will fail.</font></li>
                              <li><font color="#000000">Easy Populate should work fine on shared servers, servers with safe_mode set,
                          and servers with magic_quotes turned on or off.</font></li>
                              <li><font color="#000000">If you set the quantity of an item to zero, EP will automatically
                                make the item Inactive in the database.  To change the behavior,&nbsp;see the Configuration Variables section.</font></li>
                              <li><font color="#000000">Easy Populate does NO formatting or conversion of date formats.  It gives
                                you exactly what came out of mysql, and it takes exactly the data&nbsp;
                                you give Easy Populate and shoves it into mysql.  If you use a format that is
                                not the mysql default, you'll push bad data into your date fields&nbsp;
                                in your database.  Use this format and you'll avoid problems:
                          YYYY-MM-DD.</font></li>
                              <li><font color="#000000">Also, be aware that backslashes can confuse EP and the database
                                because the backslash character is the escape character for strings
                          in mysql. If you need a backslash in your data, add a second, so there a two together.</font></li>
                              <li style="color: #FF0000"><font color="#000000">If you have problems with text fields you may have to "escape", that is use a
                                backslashes (\), on single quotes (') and double quotes (") in product name
                          and description fields. This issue may have been solved with Excel safe output option.</font></li>

                    <p>There are several variables that may affect some with large data files when using Easy Populate. 
                    These can usually be adjusted to fit your needs in a Linux/Apache environment by adding a php.ini file in your /admin/ folder. 
                    Do check with your host on this to ensure that a) it can be done, and b) you're staying within your Terms of Service.

                    <p>When these factors come into play, often the script will simply halt with no error message.</p>
                    <p>The following php.ini settings are considered to be "default" by most hosts. Adjust higher as needed.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>max_execution_time = 30 ;(in seconds)</b><br>
                      Change this to allow for more time that PHP can process your import file.</li>
                      <li><b>max_input_time = 60 ;(in seconds)</b><br>
                      <b>post_max_size = 2M ;</b><br>
                      <b>upload_max_filesize = 2M ;</b><br>
                      These will limit the size of a file you can import using Easy Populate. This can be circumvented by uploading the file via FTP to your /temp/ folder and importing it from there.</li>
                      <li><b>memory_limit = 8M ;</b><br>
                      Change this to allow PHP to use more memory to process your file. (32M recommended)</li>
                      <li><b>session.gc_maxlifetime = 1440 ; (in seconds)</b><br>
                      Your session lifetime, should always be longer then the max_execution_time.</li>

                <h2>How to Use</h2>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Open up your internet browser and go to your osCommerce
                      Store Admin Panel<br>
                      Go to osCommerce <b> Admin</b> -> <b> Catalog</b> -> <b> Easy Populate</b></li>
                    <li>Click one of the links at the bottom of the box marked
                      &quot;<b>Create then Download Files</b>&quot;&nbsp;and save the file to your local machine.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Edit the file in Excel or OpenOffice. Windows users just right click and "Open with" -> Excel.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>After you are done editing, save the file:
                      <ul>
                        <li type="disc"> Windows-Excel users: should 
Save as... CSV (MS-DOS) in most cases, <br>
or as a &quot;Text (tab delimited)&quot; file from Excel if a tab delimited file is desired. <br>
or MAC-Excel users, Save as... Windows-CSV. (see <a href="#mac_users">Instructions for MAC Users</a> below)<br>
                        </li>
                        <li type="disc">OpenOffice users: as a "Text" file, check the "edit MORE HERE"&nbsp;</li>
                        <li type="disc">Those with special character needs (such as cyrillic), use Open Office<br>
See <a href="#roman">Special Instructions for Non-Roman Character Sets</a> (below)<br>
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>If you have more that <b><font color="#FF0000"> 300</font></b> items in your store, read the
                      <font color="#FF0000"><a href="#large_stores">SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR LARGE STORES</a>&nbsp;</font></li>
                    <li>Now go back to <b> Admin</b> -> <b> Catalog</b> -> <b> Easy Populate</b> and click the upper
                      <b> Browse</b> button,&nbsp;find your file that you want to upload, then click
                      <b> Upload and Insert Into Database</b>.</li>
                    <li>The file will be uploaded to your store.  You should see a display that lists the items you&nbsp;are importing.  If the last row appears blank, and complains that it can't import this record,&nbsp;all is fine, it's not unusual to get this error at the end of the file.</li>
                    <li>If you'd like to use FTP and upload the file, put it in the EP_TEMP_DIRECTORY directory,&nbsp;and then put the filename in the box under "Upload from Temp dir" and click Insert Into&nbsp;Database. Remember the file must be readable by the username that the web server is running&nbsp;as. You might have to chmod 777 the uploaded file to let the script read it.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <br>
                  <h2>What does EP do with my data? (How it works)</h2>
                  <p>When you upload a file, this is what EP does:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Breaks the file into lines based on the explicit field named
                      &quot;<b>EOREOR</b>&quot;.  This word &quot;<b>EOREOR</b>&quot;
                      must appear in the last field in each row of your data, or EP won't work.</li>
                    <li>Reads the first row to get the names of the fields you are importing.  This is why you must
                      have the header row in the file.</li>
                    <li>Checks to see if there is a valid product_model in the row, if it's not there, throw an error
                      and go on to the next row.</li>
                    <li>Checks to see if the category &amp; Manufacturer given exist in the database.  If they do, 
                      it updates teh category image.  If they do not exist, it creates the category/subcategories
                      as needed, and then puts the product into that category/subcategory. <br>
                      <br>
                      If you are using a
                      multilanguage shop, the category name with the language ID that is first in your language
                      Sort Order is used to compare and find the existing cateogry. You can change the language
                      Sort Order in the Admin -&gt; Localization -&gt; Languages. The language with the first Sort Order
                      will always be used to compare existing Categories. <br>
                      <br>
                      The remaining category names are updated. 
                      If another row is found with the same Model number, but a different category,
                      then that product is added to the second cateogry and all product information is updated
                      again. This is similar to the osCommerce &quot;copy Product&quot; using the Link Product method.<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>Checks to see that the product_model is not too long.  Stock OSC comes with just 12 characters
                      available for the product_model.  If you need more than 12, change your database and edit
                      easypopulate.php and change the configuration variable EP_MODEL_NUMBER_SIZE.  If it is not
                      the right size, the import stops right then.</li>
                    <li>If the product_model does not exist in the database, the product is created with the
                      information given (price, weight, qty).  If it does exist, then the database is updated.</li>
                  </ul>                
                  
                  <h2>Can I add a product to more then one category? Yes!<br>
                  </h2>
                  <p>                    Duplicate the product row, then change the category name.  Each row in the EP upload file<br>
                    will place the product in a different category the same as the osCommerce Admin does a  &quot;link&quot; to multiple categories.<br>
                  </p>

  The category hierarchy that this product should be listed under.  Note that v_categories_name_1_1 is the Highest level category, in English.<br>
                      <br>
  The first number of the categories name field is the category level. The number 1 is the highest or top category.<br>
  The second number of the categories name field is the language. The number is the language id.  In a default osC ship they will be 1 = English,&nbsp;<br>
  2 = Deutsch, 3 = Español.<br>
  An example:  If you are selling cars and you want to list a Pontiac Aztec, you'd have something like this:<br>
                      <b>  Cars</b> -> <b>       General Motors</b> -> <b>                      Pontiac</b><br>
                      <br>
  for categories, and the Aztec would be listed in the Pontiac subcategory.&nbsp;<br>
  So your data would look like this:<br>
    v_categories_name_1_1 = <b>Cars</b>, English<br>
    v_categories_name_2_1 = <b> General Motors</b>, English<br>
    v_cateogries_name_3_1 = <b>Pontiac</b>, English<br>
                      <br>
  See, highest level category to lowest level category.<br>

                    <li>'<b>v_status</b>'  The status you want to set for this item.  Defaults to Active.  To make the  product inactive, put the word Inactive in the field.
                      <font color="#FF0000">Note</font>:  If you set a&nbsp;<br>
  product with zero quantity active, and the <b> EP_INACTIVATE_ZERO_QUANTITIES</b> flag  in the configuration constants section is set to true, it will be inactive in  the database.  If you want to use different words for Active/Inactive, you can  change the configuration variables

                  <h1>Special Instructions for Large Stores<a name="large_stores">&nbsp;</a></h1>
                  If your store has over 300 products, you will likely run into PHP timeout issues.  The
                  maximum time that a script can run is set in the php.ini file.  The default is 30 seconds,
                  and it seems that most people can upload about 300 items within that time.<br>
                  <br>
                  If your store is over 300 items, you must split the file before it can be uploaded.  You
                  can do this by hand, or you can use the file-splitting feature of EP.  If you split by
                  hand remember that EP expects the first row in every file to be the headers, and will
                  throw this line out.  So if you don't have the header row, the code with not work correctly.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>
                  To split a file with EP:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Go to <b> Admin</b> -> <b> Catalog</b> -> <b> Easy Populate</b></li>
                    <li>Click the lower <b> browse</b> button and get the file you want to split.</li>
                    <li>Click the button named &quot;<b>Upload and Split file</b>&quot;.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The file will be split into sections, each with 300 products, the last one being shorter as
                  needed. These new files will be saved in the /catalog/temp directory, and will be named like
                  this: <b>EP_Split1.txt</b>, <b>EP_Split2.txt</b>, etc.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>
                  Import each file using the &quot;<b>Import EP file from Temp
                  Dir</b>&quot; section of the EP main page.<br>
                  <br>
                  If these files are still to large, edit <b> easypopulate.php</b> and change the configuration constant
                  <b>EP_SPLIT_MAX_RECORDS</b> to a smaller number. This controls how many records are put into a single
                  file when you split it. You may also increase that number if your PHP installation will handle
                  the additional records without timing-out.<br>
                  <br>
                  For those attempting to upload large files, remember, PHP has a limit built in so if your
                  upload simply refreshes the page and nothing happens, no output is provided, then you
                  may have a file that is too large for your PHP settings.<br>

                  <p>                    Because of the differences in the end-of-line characters used by Apple's operating systems,
                  after editing and saving the file, you'll need to open the file in BBedit or
                  equivalent and change the line endings to "Unix".<br>
                  <br>
                  When the product name contains characters with accents they are translated to other characters
                  in the database. ó, for example becomes A with a ~ and a superscript 3.
                  Saving the file as ISO-8859-1 solves the problem. (thanks to BenBogart for this!)<br>

                  If you want to feed your database with Cyrillic characters (or any other
                  ones) I recommend to download Open Office. <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" target="_blank">http://www.openoffice.org/</a><br>
                  <br>
                  Open Office gives you the possibility to save a csv-file with the encoding
                  you need! The OpenOffice application which you shall use for that issue is
                  CALC. It's the Open Office equivalent to Microsoft Excel.<br>
                  <br>
                  Something general to take care about - Be aware that, if you add another
                  language the language ID has most probably the "ID-4", even if you deleted one<br>
                  of the default languages before. So if you include Cyrillic fonts to a field
                  with ID 3 they might not show up then. The easiest way to check that is to
                  download an easy-populate feed and check the ID like that.<br>
                  <br>
                  After your Open-Office calc-file contains all the information you need, just
                  choose "save as" and select "Text CSV" in the dropdown menu. Under the
                  dropdown-menu check additionally "Filtereinstellungen bearbeiten" (for
                  German prog-versions) or if you use an english Open Office version, the
                  checkbox might be labeled like "change filter-settings" or something
                  similar.<br>
                  <br>
                  Then press "save" and a pop-up window appears, telling that parts of the
                  format might be lost. You press "YES" and you'll see a next dialog, where you should choose<br>
                  # encoding (many options)<br>
                  # separator for field&nbsp;<br>
                  # dividing element for text<br>
                  <br>
                  If you want to feed your database with Cyrillic letters,
                  &quot;Cyrillic windows-1251" is pretty standard and might work for you from the scratch.
                  If not, you shall experiment and try the other encodings. You will see, that
                  the prog gives you lot's of different encoding options.<br>
                  <br>
                  For me the dividing element (separator) was in any case "semi-colon" even I
                  had defined "comma" in the easy populate settings! So if you can't
                  upload with your defined separator give that a try.<br>
                  <br>
                  If you once have your file uploaded and it's successful in the database you
                  shall be aware that if you download the product-file with easy populate you
                  shall open this CSV file in any case by choosing the right encoding in the
                  opening dialog! That's important because otherwise you'll screw up the
                  encoding.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>
                  The process is anyway obvious. Also the right separator shall be easy to
                  select, because you see the result in real-time, by choosing the different
                  options for separator in the opening dialog. Then just make your changes and save it like
                  described above.<br>
                  <br>
                  This was the only version which worked for me and I hope it will help the
                  one or the other lonely nerd, feeding her/his system in the Russian (or any
                  other) way.<br>

                    <li>Compare the file you're trying to upload to the file you downloaded.    Look for missing fields.  Ignore the quotes, EP won't care about missing quotes.    Open it in a text editor instead of excel.  Look for odd characters that shouldn't be there.</li>
                    <li>Copy your import file, trim the copy to only 5 import rows and try again. If it works, you may    have a limit to the size of your upload file.  See step 5 of the installation and consult your host.</li>
                    <li>Try uploading the file you just downloaded.  If this doesn't work, you've got basic problems,
                      go to the <a href="#ask_a_question">Easy
                      Populate Support Forum</a> and describe your errors.  Please search for your error message first, if there    is no fix, then post a very specific problem report.    Don't just
                      post a message saying "It's broken", or we're likely to say, "Well, fix it!",
                      the more information you can give on the error, the
                      quicker a solution will be found.</li>
                    <li>If you can upload the unmodified downloaded file, then try adding just one product to it, and    upload that.  Keep it simple, no fancy stuff in the descriptions or anything.</li>
                  </ol>

                  <h2>When I open the export file with Excel, it changes my column data.</h2>
                  <p>The columns that Excel messes with is the model numbers (if there are dashes), and the date columns.</p>
                  <p>Excel examines the data imported from text type data documents and formats it as Excel sees fit. Luckily there is a fairly easy way to fix that.</p>
                  <p>With Excel XP there is a Data dropdown menu.  Under that menu is a menu option called Import External Data. Use this to import the CSV file into Excel.</p>
                  <p>This is a multi-step process that lets you define the field separator and column properties.  Any column Excel is modifying, you should specify a data type of text.</p>


                  <h2>My products aren't in the right categories! What now?</h2>
                  <p>Previous versions of EP required that the categories be listed from lowest to highest level categories.  This has changed, and now the categories are from left to right in the file, highest to lowest level.  So if you want your product to end up in:<br>
                  <br>
 Rocks ->       Sedimentary Rocks ->                         Limestone Rocks<br>
                  <br>
 Then your categories should be set like this in the file:<br>
 v_categories_name_1_1 = Rocks - English<br>
 v_categories_name_2_1 = Sedimentary Rocks - English<br>
 v_categories_name_3_1 = Limestone Rocks - English<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <h2>My products are going in duplicate categories instead of the one I specify, what now?</h2>
                  <p> The default osCommerce shop has a 32 character limit to the category name. So when EP
                    is importing the products, the cateogry name is truncated.  The next products import 
                    can't find the existing category because the name in the database is not complete. So
                    EP will create another, and another.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p> If you categories look like this:<br>
                    v_categories_name_1_1 = Small Category Name<br>
                    v_categories_name_2_1 = Longer Then 32 Char Category Name</p>
                  <p> They will insert like this</p>
                  <p> Small Category Name -&gt; <br>
                    Longer Then 32 Char Category Nam -&gt; Product 1<br>
                    Longer Then 32 Char Category Nam -&gt; Product 2<br>
                    Longer Then 32 Char Category Nam -&gt; Product 3<br>
                    Longer Then 32 Char Category Nam -&gt; Product 4<br>
                    Longer Then 32 Char Category Nam -&gt; Product 5<br>
                  </p>
                  <p> But should look like this</p>
                  <p> Small Category Name -&gt; <br>
                    Longer Then 32 Char Category Name -&gt; Product 1<br>
                    Product 2<br>
                    Product 3<br>
                    Product 4<br>
                    Product 5</p>
                  <p> You need to increase the number of characters the category name 
                    will allow in the database. Open your database in a SQL management
                    tool such as phpMyAdmin. Go to the categories_description table and
                    look for the categories_name field.  Edit the field and increase the
                  size to 64 or more if needed.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <h2>EasyPopulate creates a duplicate named category for every product! What now?</h2>
                  <p> If easypopulate is creating multiple categories with one product each, and the<br>
                    category names are truncated, then you have categories with more characters<br>

<p> Check to be sure that your data includes the 'EOREOR' at the end of every row.  EP starts reading the file and looks for this field in order to split it into rows.  If this field is missing, EP will never find the end of the row of data.<br>

                  <h2>The prices in the store are not what I put in the spreadsheet.</h2>
<p> Check the EP_PRICE_WITH_TAX configuration constant in the configuration variables section.  Change it to the opposite of what it is (i.e if it's false, set true, if true, set to false), and re-import. This variable tells EP that the price includes the tax rate or not.<br>

                  <p><b>Answer:</b><br>
 EP can't find the file that you uploaded for some reason. Check to see that you actually have a temp directory at the location shown.&nbsp;<br><br>
 Does the settings section of the EP screen show it is writeable? Change the setting on the file to 744 (chmod 744 temp) on a *nix box, if that still doesn't work try 777. Directories should not be left at 777, is a potential security loophole. On Windows boxes ensure that IIS has write permission to that directory.&nbsp;<br><br>
 If you do have a temp directory but it's not under&nbsp; the catalog directory, then you must go into easypopulate.php and set the EP_TEMP_DIRECTORY constant definition.<br>
                  </p>
                  <br>

                    <li> The permissions are not set correctly for your temp directory,
                      CHmod the &quot;temp&quot; directory to 777, verify by using Tools->Files and go to the temp directory, the perms should read like this
                      &quot;drwxrwxrwx&quot;</li>
                    <li> The temp dir path is wrong. First, check the path that you see in Tools->Files. Now compare that to the path in the error message. If they are not the same, edit the EP_TEMP_DIRECTORY constant definition near the top so they will match.</li>

                  <h2>About Special Characters</h2>
                  <p>
                  Special characters should be handled OK by Easy Populate, but it is recommended to use the special
                  control characters as there are some parts of osC that may not properly strip slashes from the data
                  if you use the special character instead of the control codes. Try the Excel Safe Output feature if
                  you haven't already.</p>

                  will create a file in the /catalog/temp directory, which you can get to via the Tools/Files in the

                  FROOGLE CONFIGURATION<br>
                  -----------------------------------<br>
                  To support the froogle export format, you must configure two configuration variables which should not need changing:<br>
                  <br>
                  The following should be set to the full address that an external
                  person would have to type into their browser to go directly to your
                  product info page.  Simplest way to set this is to go look at a product in your store with your browser, then copy/paste the
                  url, and chop off everything after '<b>product_info.php</b>'. (should not need changing)<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>  define ('EP_FROOGLE_PRODUCT_INFO_PATH', HTTP_CATALOG_SERVER . DIR_WS_CATALOG . "product_info.php");</b><br>
                  <br>
                  The following should be set to the full address to your images
                  directory, with the trailing slash. (Again, should not need changing)<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>  define ('EP_FROOGLE_IMAGE_PATH', HTTP_CATALOG_SERVER . DIR_WS_CATALOG_IMAGES);</b><br>
                  <br>
                  Once you've set these, test by doing a froogle export, and copy/paste the
                  product_info url into your browser.  Do the same for the image.
                  Troubleshoot until this works as expected.

                  There is no option to download product options using EP. To use EP to add and maintain Extra Fields create a file with the following columns.<br>

                  '<b>v_products_model</b>' The model number for the product. You must add this to each line and

                  '<b>v_products_extra_fields_name</b>' Case sensitive name of the extra Field. Must be exactly the same as the name of the extra field in the admin area.<br>
                  '<b>v_products_extra_fields_id</b>' This is the tricky one, it is the
                  extra fields ID. You will probably need to use PHPMyAdmin to find out what it is.<br>
                  '<b>v_products_extra_fields_value</b>' The value you want for the extra field.<br>
                  <br>

                    Easy Populate will export the large image file name.<br><br>
                    Upon import, Easy Populate will be expecting the filename specified to be
                    the large image. It will place the filename in the thumbnail image location 
                    (this is the original image location used by osCommerce for the main image)
                    and clear the other image sizes. This allows you to use the Additional Images utility
                    to process the new images for the other images sizes.<br><br>
                    if you are exporting data to change the prices or the description of a product,
                    do yourself a favor and don't export the additional images names. You will save
                    yourself trouble in the end. Otherwise, you'll need to reprocess the images sizes again.

This is easy to do. Simply FTP all or a portion of your import file to the root of your shop's hosting space (remember, no spaces in the file name.  Then post a link to the file like this: http://www.myshop.com/shop/mycsv.csv. After someone has responded, you can remove it.<br style="line-height:4px;">
                    </li>
                    <li>Post all the info and your  problem description in the support thread: <a href="http://forums.oscommerce.com/index.php?showtopic=162244" target="_blank">http://forums.oscommerce.com/index.php?showtopic=162244</a><br>
